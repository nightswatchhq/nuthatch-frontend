title: Storage & sealing
description: A hot redb tip store, content-addressed Parquet sealed past finality, unified behind one SQL surface.

Nuthatch stores data in two tiers, split at the finality boundary - and glues them behind one SQL
surface.

## Hot: the redb tip store

Recent, still-reorgable blocks live in an embedded **redb** key-value store - a single table keyed by
`(block_number, log_index)`, each row tagged with the event table it belongs to, so a reorg rollback is
a cheap range-delete above the fork block. This is the mutable tier: it's the *only* place a reorg ever
lands. Entity point-reads (`/entity/{id}`) hit it directly.

## Cold: content-addressed Parquet

Once a block range passes finality (a conservative depth), its rows are **sealed** to an immutable,
**content-addressed** (`sha256`) zstd **Parquet** segment under `segments/`, catalogued in
`manifest.json` with block bounds and row count. Segments sealed before 3.7.0 are Snappy; a nest
holding both serves across the seam. A monotonic `sealed_through` watermark advances so each
range seals exactly once, and the sealed rows are then pruned from the hot store.

Because a segment's identity is a hash over its bytes, the same range always produces the same segment -
on any machine, on any run. That's what makes segments *reusable* across nest versions (see
[Upgrading a nest](/docs/operate/upgrades/)) and shareable as a verifiable cache.

> **Sealed is immutable, forever.** Segments are sealed strictly *past finality*, so the columnar layer
> is append-only. If a change would require mutating a sealed segment, the design is wrong - go back. A
> reorg can never reach a sealed segment, by construction.

## The union: one engine over hot ∪ cold

Analytical SQL (`/sql`, `nuthatch sql`) runs on [Burrmill](https://github.com/nightswatchhq/burrmill),
an embedded query engine on DataFusion. Each session registers the sealed segments and the hot tip's
rows as one table per event, so a query spans all of history seamlessly, hot and cold. Only the
ingestion thread writes; queries only read.

Burrmill has been the only engine since 4.1.0. Releases up to 4.0.2 used DuckDB, which is no longer
in the binary; the storage tiers did not change, only the engine reading them. Because sealed segments
are plain Parquet, external readers such as DuckDB or Trino can read them directly. See
[Replacing DuckDB, after all](/blog/replacing-duckdb-after-all).

A point-read for a pruned id transparently falls back to the cold path, so `/entity/{id}` works across
the hot→cold seam without the caller knowing where the row lives.

## Big integers

Values wider than 64 bits (a `uint256`) are stored as an exact decimal string, with a derived
`{col}_dec` DECIMAL column for numeric use. A value over 38 digits exceeds DECIMAL(38,0), and neither
cast rescues it exactly: `HUGEINT` is signed 128-bit and overflows at the same order, and `DOUBLE`
loses precision past about 15 digits. See [The SQL surface](/docs/reference/sql/).
