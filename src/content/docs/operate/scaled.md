title: "Scaled mode: a fleet"
description: When one machine is no longer enough - a writer pool, an independently-scaled serving tier, and a control plane.
order: 10
---

Everything else in these docs is **embedded mode**: one binary, no external services, the thing
`curl | sh` gets you. That is still the primary way to run nuthatch and the one you should reach for
first.

Scaled mode is a different deployment for a different problem - **one operator running many nests
across many machines**. It is opt-in at build time (`--features postgres-store`), so the published
binary carries no database driver and embedded mode stays a single file with nothing beside it.

## When to reach for it

Two reasons, and neither of them is "it sounds more serious":

- **A single box can no longer hold your cursors** inside its RAM budget. A runtime is bounded per
  cursor at 2 GB, and Σ cursors has to fit the machine.
- **Serving load and ingestion load want different dials.** A backfill that saturates a writer
  shouldn't slow queries, and a traffic spike shouldn't slow indexing.

If neither applies, a [runtime](/docs/operate/many-nests/) on one machine is simpler, and that simplicity is
the point of the embedded path. Scaled mode is not an upgrade; it is a trade.

## The three roles

The same crates, run three ways. A role flag, never a fork.

| Role | Command | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| **Control plane** | `nuthatch control --db <postgres>` | *desired state* - what should run |
| **Writer** | `nuthatch dev --dir <nest>` | cursors it holds a **lease** on; ingests, decodes, seals |
| **Query-FE** | `nuthatch serve --dir <nest> --hot-store <postgres>` | nothing - serves from shared state |

```sh
nuthatch init 0xYourContract --chain arbitrum-one --dir nest
sudo chown -R 10001:10001 nest      # see below - this one is easy to miss

# Both are required. The stack refuses to start without them, by design.
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -hex 16)
export NUTHATCH_CONTROL_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)

docker compose -f docker-compose.scaled.yml --profile fleet up \
  --scale writer=2 --scale fe=3
```

Three prerequisites, all of which cost us time before they were written down:

- **The credentials have no defaults, deliberately.** The compose file used to ship
  `POSTGRES_PASSWORD: nuthatch` and a `dev-token-change-me` fallback, which defeated the binary's own
  guard in the one case it exists for: `CONTROL_BIND` is parameterised, so reaching the control plane
  from another host means setting it to `0.0.0.0` - at which point a baked-in token means the bind is
  *accepted*, protected by a string published in a public repo. Compose now fails with a message
  naming what to set, rather than starting something reachable with a credential anyone can read.

- **The fleet mounts `./nest`.** Without it the FE nodes exit and the **writers keep running** - they
  take work from the control plane rather than from disk. That asymmetry makes it look like an FE bug
  rather than a missing directory.
- **It must be owned by uid 10001.** The image runs unprivileged, so a root-owned bind mount is
  unwritable to it and the FE nodes exit with `Permission denied`. This **passes on Docker Desktop and
  fails on Linux**, because Desktop fakes mount permissions - so a Mac that works is not evidence.

## Three things to understand before you run it

These are the ones that will otherwise puzzle you at an unsociable hour.

### The control plane states intent; it commands nothing

`POST /nests` records that a nest should run and returns `200`. That does **not** mean it is running - 
it means the fleet has been told to run it. A writer picks it up on its next tick.

There is deliberately no "start this nest on worker w3" endpoint. It would be the one call able to put
a cursor somewhere the scheduler did not choose and the lease did not arbitrate.

### Ownership is a lease, and the store enforces it

A cursor is held by exactly one writer at a time. If a writer stalls - long GC, paused container, a
host that goes away for ninety seconds - its lease expires and another writer takes over.

When the original wakes up, **its writes are refused by the store**, not merely unlikely to collide.
Every write carries a fence, and a stale fence is rejected inside the same transaction as the write. A
worker that checked its own lease before writing would be checking a fact that can expire between the
check and the write; this cannot.

That is why `--scale writer=N` is safe.

### The control plane and the lease are independent, on purpose

A control-plane outage stops *rescheduling*, not *ingestion*. Writers keep their leases and keep
working.

It follows that the two can legitimately **disagree**: a writer whose heartbeat has lapsed but whose
lease is still live keeps its cursor, and the scheduler's wish to rehome it is refused. That is
correct, not a fault. A plan is not permission.

## "Why is my nest not running?"

`GET /plan` runs the same placement logic the writers run, and reports what could not be placed and
why:

```json
{"assign":[{"chain":"mainnet","worker":"writer-1"}],
 "unplaceable":[{"chain":"base","rss_mb":2400,"reason":"toolargeforanyworker",
   "detail":"this cursor alone exceeds the largest worker's budget - adding workers will not help"}]}
```

The two reasons need different responses:

- `noroomrightnow` - every worker is at its budget. **Add a worker.**
- `toolargeforanyworker` - the cursor alone exceeds the largest worker's entire budget. **Adding
  workers will not help.** Split the nests across chains, or raise the budget.

Collapsing those into one message would send you shopping for hardware that cannot fix it.

## Versions are pinned fleet-wide

Every FE node resolves an endpoint through the control plane, not through the registry's movable
`latest`:

```sh
curl -XPUT localhost:8290/nests/usdc/pin \
  -d '{"version":"1.3.0","bundle_hash":"0x…"}'
```

If each node read `latest` for itself, then during an upgrade one node would serve the new schema
while another served the old - **the same endpoint answering differently depending on where the load
balancer sent the request.** Nothing errors; the only symptom is a consumer watching a column appear
and disappear.

A declared-but-unpinned endpoint is explicitly **not servable**. An FE refuses rather than guesses,
because guessing is each node choosing a version for itself.

A *compatible* update re-pins the same endpoint. A *breaking* one is a second endpoint served
alongside the first, so existing consumers keep working - which is the whole point of the breaking
path.

## Secrets never enter a bundle

Private RPC URLs and API keys live in the control plane, keyed by nest:

```sh
curl -XPUT localhost:8290/nests/usdc/secrets \
  -d '{"key":"rpc_url","value":"https://private…"}'
```

A writer receives only the secrets of the nests it is actually assigned. The interface is
**write-only** - you can list which keys exist, never read a value back.

Baking a credential into a content-addressed bundle would leak it *and* break addressing, since two
nests differing only in credentials would hash differently. Because secrets sit outside, **rotating
one changes no bundle hash**, so it never invalidates segment reuse or forces a re-index.

## Exposure

The control plane **refuses to start** off-localhost without `NUTHATCH_CONTROL_TOKEN`. Not a warning - 
a refusal. It decides what an entire fleet runs, so an unauthenticated one on a public interface is
not a configuration anyone chooses on purpose.

`/health` stays unauthenticated so a load balancer can probe it; it reveals nothing.

## What scaled mode is not

Per-tenant billing, metering, quotas, or authz between mutually-untrusting **paying** customers. Those
belong to a gateway in front of nuthatch and are deliberately out of scope.

The line: *multi-nest co-tenancy* and *distributed self-hosted* mode are both in scope - one operator's
cooperating nests. Charging strangers for isolated access is a different product.

## Where nests come from

The scheduler decides which machine holds a cursor, so the machine that ends up holding it may have
nothing on disk. A worker indexes whatever is under `--nest-root` and **pulls anything else** from a
registry:

```sh
nuthatch worker --registry s3://my-nests/registry …
```

What is on the box wins. A nest you placed there is a deliberate act - often a hand-edited view or a
debug build - and is never silently replaced by the registry's copy.

**Pin the bundle, not just the version.** With a `bundle_hash` pinned, a worker fetches by **content
address** and never consults the registry's index, so re-tagging `1.0.0` cannot change what any worker
runs. Unpinned, your fleet is exactly as trustworthy as your registry.

Pulled bundles are cached at `<--nest-cache>/<name>/<hash>`. Content-addressed, so re-pinning resolves
to a different directory and actually re-pulls rather than quietly reusing what is already there - and
so the cache is safe to delete at any time.

## Honest limits

**Until 0.9.3 the writer pool did not write.** `worker` registered, took leases, loaded secrets and
reported - and contained no indexing code at all. A worker acquired a cursor and did nothing with it.

Read the previous version of this section as a cautionary tale: it said *"10/10, nothing skipped"*, and
that was **true**. Those ten checks are real and they passed. But every one of them tested the control
plane - registration, planning, lease fencing, version pinning, secrets - and **not one asserted that a
row appeared.** A suite that verifies the machinery around a thing rather than the thing reads exactly
like a suite that works.

**Now verified across real machines** (three Hetzner boxes on a private network, published artifacts,
control plane and store on one box and writers on their own):

- workers registering and being scheduled from another machine
- a real lease handover under contention, with the store-enforced fence advancing
- a 10-minute clock jump moving lease expiry rather than ownership
- **indexing into the shared store** - `last_block` advancing, the check that could not have passed before
- **377 blocks indexed through a 90-second control-plane outage.** Losing the control plane stops
  *rescheduling*, not *ingestion*; that split is the design, and it now has a number attached.

**Not yet verified:** the registry pull above has a runbook check that deletes a writer's nest and
asserts it pulls one anyway, and that check has not been run on real machines yet.

**Scaled mode remains younger and less exercised than embedded mode**, which runs in production. If one
process per box is enough, that is still the shape to reach for.
