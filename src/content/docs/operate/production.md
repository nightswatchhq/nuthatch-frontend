description: The whole path from a fresh box to a nest serving unattended - endpoint check, layout, service, exposure, backups, alerts, and what to do when it breaks.
order: 3
---

The other pages in this section each cover one surface. This one is the **path**: follow it top to
bottom on a fresh box and you end up with something you can leave running.

It assumes one machine and one chain. For many nests see [roosts](/docs/operate/roosts/); for more
than one machine see [scaled mode](/docs/operate/scaled/). Neither is a prerequisite, and one box is
the honest default.

## 0. What you need

- A Linux box. Two cores and 4 GB of RAM is comfortable for a single cursor, whose budget is 2 GB.
- Disk for sealed history. Parquet segments are compact but they grow forever, so give it room and
  watch it. A busy nest's segments are the thing that fills a disk, not the hot store.
- **An RPC endpoint that can actually serve a backfill.** This is the single most common cause of a
  bad first day, and it is checkable in advance. Do not skip step 1.

## 1. Check the endpoint before you trust it

```sh
nuthatch doctor --rpc https://your-endpoint/ --address 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1D19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48
```

`doctor` probes the three limits that otherwise surface mid-backfill as a retry loop that merely looks
like slowness: max `eth_getLogs` width, max JSON-RPC batch size, and archive depth. It prints the
largest safe `--window` for that endpoint.

Two failure modes worth knowing before they cost you an afternoon:

- **Archive depth.** Several well-known free endpoints answer only ~100 blocks behind tip and return
  an "archive requests require a token" error beyond that. Such an endpoint cannot serve a backfill at
  all, however fast it looks on a tip query.
- **Range caps.** Providers refuse an oversized range in inconsistent ways, sometimes with a 400 that
  reads like a client error. nuthatch splits and adapts around these, but an endpoint with a tight cap
  and no batching will be slow no matter what you set.

Pass `--address` so the probe matches what a real nest asks for; some endpoints cap an unfiltered
query harder than a filtered one.

## 2. Lay the box out

```text
/opt/nuthatch/my-nest/       the nest: nuthatch.toml, abis/, views/, checks/, and its data
/usr/local/bin/nuthatch      the binary
```

Create an unprivileged user that owns only the nest directory:

```sh
sudo useradd --system --home /opt/nuthatch --shell /usr/sbin/nologin nuthatch
sudo install -d -o nuthatch -g nuthatch /opt/nuthatch
```

Get the nest itself either by scaffolding from an address, or by loading a published one:

```sh
# from a contract address
nuthatch init 0xA0b8… --chain mainnet --dir /opt/nuthatch/my-nest

# or a published nest, verified by content hash
nuthatch nest load https://…/my-nest.bundle --dir /opt/nuthatch/my-nest
```

A loaded bundle is checked against its manifest: every file's hash, plus a decode registry
regenerated from the inputs and compared to the pinned one. A nest that loads decodes exactly as its
author intended. See [the registry](/docs/operate/registry/).

## 3. Do the backfill deliberately, before it is a service

Run the history once by hand so you watch it finish and know how long it takes:

```sh
sudo -u nuthatch nuthatch dev --dir /opt/nuthatch/my-nest \
  --seal-direct --concurrency 8 --window "$(: use what doctor told you)"
```

`--seal-direct` writes finalized history straight to Parquet instead of through the hot store, which
is much faster for a from-deployment backfill. Let it reach the tip, then stop it. The service you
install next will resume rather than start over.

If the nest ships `checks/`, prove it before serving anyone:

```sh
nuthatch check --dir /opt/nuthatch/my-nest
```

## 4. Install the service

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/nuthatch@.service   (templated, so one unit serves many nests)
[Unit]
Description=nuthatch indexer (%i)
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=nuthatch
WorkingDirectory=/opt/nuthatch/%i
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/nuthatch dev --dir /opt/nuthatch/%i \
          --listen 127.0.0.1:8288 --seal-direct --concurrency 8
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5
# The per-cursor budget. A regression gets killed and restarted rather than taking the box with it.
MemoryMax=2G
# Least privilege: it needs its own directory and the network, nothing else.
NoNewPrivileges=true
PrivateTmp=true
ProtectSystem=strict
ProtectHome=true
ReadWritePaths=/opt/nuthatch/%i

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```sh
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now nuthatch@my-nest
journalctl -u nuthatch@my-nest -f
```

`MemoryMax=2G` matches the budget nuthatch holds itself to, so the two agree rather than fight.

Shutdown is graceful: SIGTERM drains in-flight requests and checkpoints the ingest task, so a restart
resumes cleanly.

## 5. Decide exposure on purpose

nuthatch binds `127.0.0.1` by default and that default is doing real work. **The API has no
authentication of its own** - the guards bound *how much* a query can cost, never *who* may ask.

Put a reverse proxy in front and give it TLS and auth:

```caddy
indexer.example.com {
    basic_auth {
        reader $2a$14$…          # caddy hash-password
    }
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8288
}
```

Then make three decisions explicitly rather than by default:

| Surface | Decision |
|---|---|
| `/sql` | A real analytical surface. Guarded, but a caller can still ask expensive questions. Read [security](/docs/operate/security/) before exposing it to anyone you do not trust. |
| `/_admin/` | **Mutates state** - it mounts and unmounts nests. Off localhost it requires `NUTHATCH_ADMIN_TOKEN` set *and* presented per request. Want no remote admin at all? Bind localhost and pass `--no-admin`. |
| `/health`, `/ready` | Unauthenticated by design so a load balancer can probe them. Leave them reachable. |

## 6. Watch the two numbers that matter

Scrape `GET /metrics`. Alert on these and treat everything else as diagnosis material:

- **`nuthatch_tip_lag_blocks`** - sustained growth means you are not keeping up, and it is nearly
  always the RPC endpoint rather than nuthatch.
- **`nuthatch_rss_bytes`** - approaching the 2 GB per-cursor ceiling.

A frozen `nuthatch_last_poll_unixtime` means a stalled poller, which is the failure that otherwise
looks like "the data just stopped being interesting". In a roost, add `nuthatch_nest_health` and
`nuthatch_cursor_live`, because a *partly* unwell roost still answers `/health` on the whole. Full
list in [metrics](/docs/operate/metrics/).

`/ready` is the honest liveness signal for a load balancer: it answers *is this nest caught up*, and
reports `stalled` when every endpoint in the pool is refusing a window.

## 7. Back it up

The nest directory is the whole of it. Sealed segments are content-addressed and immutable, so they
copy safely **while the process runs**:

```sh
rsync -a /opt/nuthatch/my-nest/ backup:/backups/my-nest/
```

Restoring is putting the directory back and starting the binary. No schema migration, no external
state to reconcile.

Worth knowing what is precious and what is not: `nuthatch.toml`, `abis/`, `views/` and `checks/` are
authored and must be kept. `nuthatch.redb`, `segments/` and `.duckdb/` are derived - losing them costs
a re-backfill, not data you cannot recover.

## 8. Know your upgrade path before you need it

Two different axes, and conflating them is the usual confusion:

- **The binary**: a swap and a restart. A newer release reads an older one's hot store and sealed
  segments as they are. Back up the old binary first, restart one nest, check it, then the rest.
- **The nest** (its schema, views or decode): `nest diff` classifies the change as compatible or
  breaking, and `nest upgrade` performs it with no downtime. See [upgrades](/docs/operate/upgrades/).

Verify parity rather than assuming it: note a few row counts before, re-run them after. Query
responses carry a `provenance` block whose `registry_hash` fingerprints the decode and schema, so an
unchanged hash across an upgrade is proof the nest still produces the same answers.

## 9. Prove it, do not assume it

```sh
./scripts/verify.sh 0 4
```

An acceptance runbook where every step is falsifiable, covering the artifact, a single nest,
correctness, a roost, and the guards. See [verifying a deployment](/docs/operate/verifying/), which
also states plainly which levels we have run ourselves and which we have not.

## Pre-flight checklist

Before you walk away from it:

- [ ] `doctor` passed against the endpoint you are actually using
- [ ] Backfill completed by hand, and you know how long it took
- [ ] `nuthatch check` passes, if the nest ships checks
- [ ] Service is enabled, survives `systemctl restart`, and comes back after a reboot
- [ ] `MemoryMax` set, and the box has headroom above it for queries
- [ ] Bound to localhost, with a proxy terminating TLS and auth in front
- [ ] `NUTHATCH_ADMIN_TOKEN` set, or `--no-admin` passed, and you know which and why
- [ ] `/metrics` scraped, with alerts on tip lag and RSS
- [ ] A backup that has been **restored once**, because an untested backup is a hope
- [ ] Someone knows where [troubleshooting](/docs/operate/troubleshooting/) lives

## When it breaks

Start at [troubleshooting](/docs/operate/troubleshooting/), which is organised symptom to metric to
remedy. The three that account for most of it:

- **Tip lag climbing** - the endpoint, nearly always. Re-run `doctor` against it.
- **A `503` from `/sql`** - a guard did its job. Two queries are already running, or one asked for
  more of the unsealed tip than the budget allows. Retry or narrow the query; do not raise the gate.
- **A nest quarantined in a roost** - its siblings are fine by design. `GET /nests` carries the fault
  and the re-admission time.
