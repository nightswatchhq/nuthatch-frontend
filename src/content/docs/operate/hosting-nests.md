title: Host nests for others
description: Run one runtime that other people's nests are mounted into over an API - publish, price, mount by identity, pause, move, reclaim and meter, with no orchestration on your side.

---

This is the guide for running nuthatch **as a host**: one runtime, started with nothing in it, that
nests are added to, paused, moved and removed over an HTTP API while it keeps serving the rest. It is
the shape a platform uses, and it is equally the shape of one operator who wants to manage a box by
script instead of by editing files and restarting.

The whole contract fits in a sentence: **you hand the runtime a nest identity (NID), and the runtime
fetches it, verifies it, stores it, indexes it and serves it.** Nothing on your side unpacks bundles,
runs schema tools or starts processes. Everything below is available since **3.13.0**; run **3.13.1** or later, which fixes restarts
during moves and suspensions, validates names, and serves `/metrics` at the runtime root.

What stays outside the runtime, by design: who your callers are, what they may do, what they pay, and
how the process is supervised. nuthatch sees a tenant as an opaque label and knows nothing else about
it. Sign-in, plans, per-tenant authorisation, quotas and billing belong to a gateway in front of the
runtime; process supervision belongs to systemd or a container restart policy.

## The moving parts

- **A nest** is authored inputs (config, ABIs, views) packed into a content-addressed **bundle**.
- **A NID** is the nest's identity: the key its data is stored under, `data/<nid>/`. Change anything
  that changes what the nest indexes and you get a new NID; upgrading the nuthatch binary does not.
- **A registry** is where bundles live: a directory or an S3-compatible bucket. See
  [the nest registry](/docs/operate/registry/).
- **A runtime** is one `nuthatch dev --dir <dir>` process over a directory with a `mounts.toml`. It
  hosts many nests, with one cursor per chain. See [run many nests](/docs/operate/many-nests/).
- **A mount** gives a NID a name, served at `/<name>/`. Two mounts may share one NID and one dataset.

## 1. Publish the nests you will host

On the machine where a nest is built:

```sh
nuthatch nest bundle ./usdc                  # → usdc-<hash>.bundle
nuthatch nest publish usdc-<hash>.bundle --registry /srv/registry --as usdc@1.0.0
nuthatch nest nid --dir ./usdc               # the NID a host mounts it by
```

`nest publish` prints the NID as well as the hash. The registry indexes every bundle by NID, so a NID
is all a host needs: `nuthatch nest load <nid> --registry /srv/registry` pulls it anywhere, and refuses
a bundle whose own manifest does not compute to the NID asked for.

## 2. Start an empty runtime

Declare the chains you will serve, and nothing else:

```toml
# /srv/runtime/mounts.toml
[runtime]
name = "host-1"
max_rss_mb = 2048              # per-cursor RAM ceiling

[[chains]]
chain = "mainnet"
chain_id = 1
rpc_urls = ["https://…"]

[[chains]]
chain = "base"
chain_id = 8453
rpc_urls = ["https://…"]
```

```sh
export NUTHATCH_ADMIN_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
nuthatch dev --dir /srv/runtime --listen 0.0.0.0:8288 --registry /srv/registry
```

- **Chains are declared at boot**, and only there. A chain's RPC is dialled when the first nest is
  mounted onto it, so an unused chain, or one whose endpoint is down when the process starts, cannot
  stop the runtime. Adding a chain means a restart.
- **`--registry`** lets a mount fetch a NID the runtime does not hold. Without it, only NIDs already
  under `data/` can be mounted.
- **The admin API needs `NUTHATCH_ADMIN_TOKEN` off localhost.** Bound anywhere but localhost without
  it, the runtime serves no admin routes at all, and an empty runtime then refuses to start, since
  nothing could ever be mounted into it. `--no-admin` removes the routes everywhere.

Every admin call below takes the token as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (or `?token=<token>`);
the examples set it once in a shell alias, with the `Content-Type: application/json` every `POST` needs,
including the bodiless suspend and resume (without it the API answers `415`):

```sh
alias nh='curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $NUTHATCH_ADMIN_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json"'
```

## 3. Price a nest before you mount it

```sh
nh -XPOST 'localhost:8288/_admin/nests?dry_run=true' -d '{"name":"usdc","nid":"9f2c…"}'
```

```json
{
  "name": "usdc", "nid": "9f2c…", "fetched": true, "shares": null,
  "chain": "mainnet", "start_block": 6082465, "tip": 21000000, "blocks_to_backfill": 14917535,
  "has_data": false, "per_block_rpc": ["[extract] blocks"],
  "incoming_mb": 180, "projected_mb": 420, "ceiling_mb": 2048,
  "refusal": null, "refusal_status": null
}
```

A dry run runs **the same admission checks a real mount runs** and mounts nothing, so its
`refusal_status` is exactly what the mount would answer. What each field tells you:

- `blocks_to_backfill` is the history ahead of it. `tip` is known only for a chain whose cursor is
  already running, since a dry run dials nothing; `has_data: true` means a dataset is already on disk
  and the figure is an upper bound.
- `per_block_rpc` lists extraction that costs RPC calls for every block on top of the shared
  `eth_getLogs`: `[extract] blocks`, `traces`, `top_level_calls`, `state`, `[[calls]]`. An empty list
  is the cheap case. See [costs](/docs/operate/costs/).
- `projected_mb` is the chain cursor's footprint with this nest added, against `ceiling_mb`.
- `shares` names a mount that already indexes this dataset: mounting it again costs nothing further.

If the NID had to be fetched, it was fetched and verified, and it stays installed for the real mount.

## 4. Mount it

```sh
nh -XPOST localhost:8288/_admin/nests -d '{"name":"usdc","nid":"9f2c…"}'
# 202 {"name":"usdc","nid":"9f2c…","phase":"accepted","since_unixtime":1790700000}
```

A mount is a **job**, because fetching and catching up can take minutes. Poll it:

```sh
nh localhost:8288/_admin/mounts/usdc     # one job
nh localhost:8288/_admin/mounts          # {"mounts": [...]} - every mount the runtime knows
```

| `phase` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `accepted` | Recorded, not yet started. |
| `fetching` | Pulling the bundle from the registry and verifying it. Only when the runtime did not hold it. |
| `joining` | Catching up beside its chain's cursor before joining it, so co-tenants are never dragged back through history. |
| `live` | Indexing and serving at `/<name>/`. |
| `failed` | Refused or broken; `reason` says why. |
| `suspended` | Paused by the operator: off its cursor, answering `503`, until resumed. |

**`live` means indexing and serving, not caught up.** A mount onto a chain that already has a cursor
catches up beside it before it goes live. The first mount onto a chain starts the cursor and backfills
inside it, so it is `live` while history is still arriving. `/<name>/ready` gives the distance:
`lag_blocks` is how far behind the tip the nest is, and `ready` stays `true` while it catches up, since
readiness means serving and advancing. Treat a nest as caught up when `lag_blocks` is small.

Reading a job never waits on a mount in progress. Jobs are written to `mount-jobs.json` in the
runtime directory: after a restart an unfinished job resumes, and a failed one stays readable until
the name is mounted again or unmounted.

**Posting again is safe.** The same name and NID answers `202` with the running job, or `200` once it
is live. The same name with another NID is `409`: changing a live mount's nest is a move (step 7).

`?wait=true` answers only when the mount has finished, with the synchronous statuses below. It suits a
script; a platform should poll.

| Status | Why |
|---|---|
| `400` | A malformed NID, or a name the runtime would not accept (see step 5). |
| `401` | No token, or the wrong one. |
| `404` | The runtime does not hold the NID and was started without `--registry`. With `--registry`, a NID the registry lacks ends the job `failed` instead, its reason naming the NID. |
| `409` | The name is taken, the nest's chain is not declared, or that chain's cursor has died (restart the runtime). |
| `507` | The mount would breach the chain cursor's RAM ceiling; the reason carries projected and ceiling MB. |

On the job route the same refusals end the job `failed` with the same reason. A nest the runtime
fetched and then refused is removed again: a refusal leaves nothing on disk.

Once live, the nest's full API is under its name: `/usdc/sql`, `/usdc/tables`, `/usdc/ready`. `GET
/nests` lists every live mount with its health, and `GET /ready` answers for the whole runtime.

## 5. Tenants and names

A mount's name is its route. For more than one party, name mounts `tenant/alias`:

```sh
nh -XPOST localhost:8288/_admin/nests -d '{"name":"acme/usdc","nid":"9f2c…"}'
nh -XPOST localhost:8288/_admin/nests -d '{"name":"globex/usdc","nid":"9f2c…"}'
```

Both mounts serve **one dataset**, indexed once. The tenant is a label nuthatch refcounts and knows
nothing else about: it never authenticates it, limits it or bills it.

**A mount's route depends on its own tenant alone** (3.13.1): the default tenant's mounts serve by
alias, under `/usdc`, and every other tenant's under `/acme/usdc`. Adding or removing another tenant, and
restarting, never moves a route.

A name is `alias` or `tenant/alias`, each part letters, digits, `_` and `-`, at most 64 characters. An
alias may not end in `__moving`, which a move uses for the nest it stages, and the default tenant is
never spelled out: mount `usdc`, not `default/usdc`. Any other name is refused with `400` before
anything is written.

## 6. Pause and resume

```sh
nh -XPOST localhost:8288/_admin/suspend/usdc     # 200 {"suspended":"usdc"}
nh -XPOST localhost:8288/_admin/resume/usdc      # 202, a mount job
```

A suspended mount leaves its cursor and releases its store, and its routes answer `503` with
`"suspended": true`, so a caller can tell a paused nest from a missing one. Its data and its record are
kept, and it **stays suspended across a restart** (`mounts.toml` lists it under `suspended`). A
suspended mount costs no RPC and no memory; it keeps its disk.

Resume is an ordinary mount of the recorded NID: it catches up from where it stopped, and serves the
`503` until it has joined. Resuming a quarantined mount is its explicit release. Suspending a name that
is not mounted is `404`; resuming one that is not suspended is `404`. While paused, its job reads
`suspended`, and posting a mount for the name resumes it just as `resume` does.

## 7. Move a name to a new version

A new version of a nest is a new NID. To repoint a name without a gap:

```sh
nh -XPOST localhost:8288/_admin/move/usdc -d '{"nid":"4a71…"}'    # 202, a job under "usdc"
```

The runtime mounts the new NID beside the old one, catches it up, and then switches the name's routes in
**one step**. A reader polling `/usdc` sees the old nest until that step and the new nest after it,
and never an error in between. The old nest is then taken off its cursor. A move keeps its chain; a
move whose new nest is refused leaves the old one serving and removes anything it fetched.

To keep the old version reachable, mount its NID under another name first; the move leaves that mount
alone.

## 8. Unmount and reclaim disk

```sh
nh -XDELETE localhost:8288/_admin/nests/usdc                    # 200 {"unmounted":"usdc"}
nh -XDELETE 'localhost:8288/_admin/nests/usdc?reclaim=true'     # and free the disk
nh -XDELETE localhost:8288/_admin/datasets/9f2c…                # free one unmounted earlier
```

An unmount keeps the dataset, so mounting it again is free. Reclaiming removes it once **no mount
names it**; a dataset another mount still uses is kept and the answer says by whom:

```json
{"outcome": "kept", "nid": "9f2c…", "mounted_by": ["globex/usdc"]}
```

`DELETE /_admin/datasets/<nid>` answers `200` when it reclaimed, `409` when it kept, `404` when there
was nothing there. Inside a running runtime a reclaim removes the dataset and the segments only it
references. Segments a live nest may still be reading are left for `nuthatch prune`, run offline.

## 9. Meter it

The runtime serves `/metrics` at its root, before anything is mounted, broken down per mount with the
label `{nest="<name>"}`:

| Series | Use |
|---|---|
| `nuthatch_nest_hot_store_bytes` | This nest's hot store on disk. |
| `nuthatch_nest_sealed_segments_bytes` | The sealed segments this nest's manifest names. |
| `nuthatch_nest_last_block`, `nuthatch_nest_tip_lag_blocks` | Where it is, and whether it is keeping up. |
| `nuthatch_nest_rows_decoded_total` | Indexing work done. |
| `nuthatch_nest_health` | `1` indexing, `0` quarantined. |

Segments are content-addressed and shared: a segment two datasets both contain counts under both
nests. For disk actually used, read the unlabelled `nuthatch_sealed_segments_bytes`, which counts each
segment store once. A mount that shares another's dataset has no storage series of its own; its bytes
are reported under the mount that indexes it. See [metrics](/docs/operate/metrics/) for the full list.

## 10. Put a gateway in front

The runtime is the data plane. What it protects is itself: a RAM budget per cursor, query timeouts, a
bounded SQL surface per mount, and the admin token. What it does not do is know your users. A gateway
in front should:

- terminate TLS and authenticate callers;
- map a caller to the mounts they may read, and route `/<name>/` only for those;
- hold the admin token and never expose `/_admin/` to callers;
- meter and bill from the per-nest series above and from its own request log.

Keep the admin API on a private interface or behind the gateway only. The token is the one thing
between the network and a mount.

## 11. Restarts and upgrades

- **Restart** at any time. Mounts come back from `mounts.toml`, suspended mounts stay suspended,
  unfinished jobs resume, and a fetch a killed process left half-staged is cleared first.
- **Upgrade the binary** by replacing it and restarting. NIDs are independent of the nuthatch version,
  so no dataset moves and nothing re-indexes. See [upgrades](/docs/operate/upgrades/).
- **Supervise** the process with systemd or a container restart policy. A runtime whose every cursor
  has died exits non-zero so the supervisor restarts it; a runtime with nothing mounted, or whose
  nests have all been unmounted, stays up and waits.

## The whole walkthrough

```sh
# build side
nuthatch nest bundle ./usdc
nuthatch nest publish usdc-<hash>.bundle --registry /srv/registry --as usdc@1.0.0
NID=$(nuthatch nest nid --dir ./usdc)

# host side
nuthatch dev --dir /srv/runtime --listen 0.0.0.0:8288 --registry /srv/registry &
nh -XPOST 'localhost:8288/_admin/nests?dry_run=true' -d "{\"name\":\"acme/usdc\",\"nid\":\"$NID\"}"
nh -XPOST localhost:8288/_admin/nests -d "{\"name\":\"acme/usdc\",\"nid\":\"$NID\"}"
nh localhost:8288/_admin/mounts/acme/usdc          # until "phase": "live"
curl -s 'localhost:8288/acme/usdc/sql?q=SELECT%201'

# later
nh -XPOST localhost:8288/_admin/suspend/acme/usdc
nh -XPOST localhost:8288/_admin/resume/acme/usdc
nh -XPOST localhost:8288/_admin/move/acme/usdc -d '{"nid":"<new nid>"}'
nh -XDELETE 'localhost:8288/_admin/nests/acme/usdc?reclaim=true'
```

The same API is documented route by route in the [HTTP API reference](/docs/reference/http-api/).
