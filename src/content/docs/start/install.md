nuthatch is **one binary**. No Postgres, no Docker, no IPFS, no account - install it and
you're done.

## The one-liner

```sh
curl -fsSL https://nuthatch-indexer.com/install.sh | sh
```

The script detects your platform, downloads the matching release binary, verifies its checksum, and
installs `nuthatch` to `~/.local/bin` (override with `NUTHATCH_INSTALL_DIR`). It's short and
[readable on GitHub](https://github.com/nightswatchhq/nuthatch-frontend/blob/main/public/install.sh) -
audit it first if `curl | sh` makes you itch.

Prebuilt binaries cover **macOS (Apple Silicon)**, **Linux x86_64** and, from 4.11.1, **Linux arm64**.
Intel Mac is deliberately not built. Each release carries `nuthatch-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`,
`nuthatch-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`, `nuthatch-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz` (from 4.11.1)
and, for [scaled mode](/docs/operate/scaled/), `nuthatch-scaled-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`, each
with a `.sha256` beside it. On a platform with no prebuilt binary, or on Linux arm64 while the latest
release has none, the installer stops and prints the source-build command below rather than install
something that will not run.

The Linux binaries are dynamically linked and need **glibc 2.35 or newer**, measured off the published
artifact with `objdump -T`: from 4.1.0 the x86_64 binary references `hypot` at `GLIBC_2.35`, and the
arm64 binary, built natively on Ubuntu 22.04, references nothing newer. It links `libc`, `libm`
and `libgcc` and no C++ runtime; releases before 4.1 embedded DuckDB, needed only glibc 2.34, and also
needed libstdc++ from GCC 11. Debian 12 and Ubuntu 22.04 clear it. RHEL 9 and Amazon Linux 2023 ship
glibc 2.34 and ran 4.0.x; from 4.1.0 they need the source build.

Every artifact since 3.0 also has a GitHub build-provenance attestation, which establishes the producing
repository and workflow rather than merely the integrity of bytes in transit:

```sh
gh attestation verify nuthatch-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz --repo nightswatchhq/nuthatch
```

The `--repo` constraint matters. Without it, an attestation from any repository may be accepted.

## The graph build

The default binary has no GraphQL route: `POST /graphql` answers 404. From 4.11.0 every release also
carries `nuthatch-graph-<target>.tar.gz`, built with `--features graph` and attested like the others,
for `aarch64-apple-darwin` and `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, and for `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` from
4.11.1. It serves a nest's Graph-dialect GraphQL at `/graphql` and `/subgraphs/id/<deployment>`, and has
every command the default binary has. The installer does not fetch it:

```sh
gh release download --repo nightswatchhq/nuthatch -p 'nuthatch-graph-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz*'
shasum -a 256 -c nuthatch-graph-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz.sha256
tar -xzf nuthatch-graph-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz    # one binary, named nuthatch
```

A nest answers GraphQL only once it carries a `graph/schema.graphql`, which `nuthatch port-emit`
writes; until then the route says so. What it answers is a partial read surface, exact for a
subgraph's event-shaped fields and a refusal by name for the rest, not a drop-in replacement for a
subgraph: see [Subgraph fallback](/docs/build/subgraph-fallback/).

## Container image

```sh
docker run --rm ghcr.io/nightswatchhq/nuthatch:4.11.1 --version
```

`:latest` follows the newest release; pin the version for anything you care about. `linux/amd64`
only for now, and no image carries the graph build: on an arm64 Linux host, or to serve GraphQL, use a
binary. The image carries the **same binary attached to the GitHub Release**, so the two cannot
drift. Scaled mode needs the `-scaled` tag (`4.11.1-scaled`): the default image is the embedded build
and carries no database driver. See [Deploy it](/docs/operate/deploy/) for running it properly.

## From source

Only needed on a platform we do not publish a binary for. **The toolchain pin is required, not
advisory:**

```sh
rustup toolchain install 1.95.0
cargo +1.95.0 install --git https://github.com/nightswatchhq/nuthatch nuthatch
```

`rust-toolchain.toml` pins 1.95.0 because `dbsp` hits a next-trait-solver ICE on 1.97 - and **that
file does not apply to `cargo install --git`**, which builds in a temporary directory of its own. So
the pin cannot protect this path and you have to ask for it. Without `+1.95.0`, a 1.97 default
toolchain fails after a full dependency build with `error: could not compile dbsp` and installs
nothing.

This page previously said a plain `cargo install` on recent stable worked. It does not, and has not
since rustc 1.97 - see [#534](https://github.com/nightswatchhq/nuthatch/issues/534).

## Verify

```sh
nuthatch --version
```

Then take the two-minute path: [Quickstart](/docs/start/quickstart/) - from a contract address to a
live, queryable API.

```sh
nuthatch init 0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2 --alias weth   # WETH - chain auto-detected
nuthatch dev --backfill 300
```

`--backfill 300` starts 300 blocks behind the tip, so there are rows within seconds. Without it `dev`
backfills from the contract's deployment block, which for a contract with a long history wants your
own archive-capable RPC.

Nothing phones home: no telemetry, no API token, no gated data service. AI features are BYO-key or
local models and degrade gracefully offline.
