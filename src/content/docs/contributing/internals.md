description: A component-by-component walk through the binary - the ingest loop, the decode registry, the two storage layers, reorg handling, the IVM core, and what changes in scaled mode.
order: 2

This is the long version, for people who need to know *why* it is safe rather than *that* it is. It
follows one log entry from an RPC response to a row someone queries, then covers what each component
refuses to do, which is usually the more interesting half.

Line counts are given as a sense of weight, not a metric. The binary is about 40,000 lines of Rust.

## The shape of it

                                       analytical SQL from DuckDB over
                                       segments ∪ tip, MCP over the same
```

The whole design turns on one split: **the hot store is mutable and the cold store is not.** Every
other guarantee is downstream of it.

## Ingest — `rpc.rs`, `indexer.rs`

`indexer.rs` is the loop that makes it alive: poll logs, decode, store, and serve concurrently. One
process, one cursor, one observable failure boundary.

`rpc.rs` is a deliberately thin JSON-RPC client — `eth_blockNumber`, `eth_getLogs`, block headers,
and `eth_call` — with round-robin failover across the configured endpoints and per-endpoint health
tracking. Two behaviours are worth calling out because they were both learned the hard way:

**Failures are classified, not merely retried.** A rate limit, a transport blip, an oversized-range
refusal and a rejected credential are four different things. An auth rejection is cooled down loudly
rather than retried forever; a 429 escalates across the pool; an oversized range is split and retried,
taking the provider's own suggested range when it offers one.

**A failure we cannot classify is split once anyway.** Providers phrase the same refusal a dozen ways
and invent new phrasings without telling anyone. Running Sentio's OBIB benchmark found the cost of
getting this wrong: Alchemy returns its oversized-range refusal as HTTP **400**, a status the
classifier did not enumerate, so the window was retried unchanged — forever. The benchmark did not run
slowly, it never finished. Speculative splitting means an endpoint whose phrasing we have never seen
degrades instead of hanging.

**The log window adapts.** Every provider caps `eth_getLogs` differently, most document it wrongly,
and several vary it by tier. So the window widens while an endpoint keeps up and narrows the moment it
does not — the real limit is discovered rather than configured. `nuthatch doctor` runs that discovery
on demand and reports what an endpoint will actually serve.

## Decode — `registry.rs`

The decode registry is the determinism boundary. Given each contract's resolved ABI, it builds one
immutable map from `topic0` → decoders, filtered by emitting address, and turns any log into a typed
row keyed to a per-`(alias, event)` table.

It is plain deterministic Rust. **No LLM is anywhere near this path**, by rule — models generate code
and tests, never runtime data.

The registry's **content hash** (a sha256 over a canonical, order-independent serialisation) is
recorded in every sealed segment's manifest and returned in query provenance. That hash is what makes
re-execution checkable: two operators indexing the same range with the same registry produce
byte-identical segments, and a query result can be traced to the exact decode that produced it.

Decodings are **versioned, never retroactive**. When an ABI improves, history is not silently
re-decoded — that would change answers under consumers who already have them.

## The hot store — `store.rs`

redb, embedded, holding the mutable tip. Four tables: `entities`, `meta`, `blocks`, `outbox`.

Entities are keyed `{block:012}-{log_index:06}`, zero-padded so lexicographic iteration is
chain-ordered — which makes "everything above block N" a range scan rather than a filter, and that is
exactly what a reorg needs.

One honest note the module carries about itself: it used to claim a single writer, and that was
wrong. Two tasks write — the ingest loop, and the alert-delivery worker draining the outbox. They
touch disjoint key ranges and redb serialises write transactions internally, so integrity holds, but
the comment was a claim about the code that the code did not honour. It now says what is true.

## Sealing — `seal.rs`

Once a range is final, each table's rows in that range are written to their own content-addressed
Parquet segment — `{table}-{hash}.parquet` — catalogued in a manifest, and then pruned from hot.

**Finality is per chain, not a constant.** `chains.rs` carries the policy as data:

| chain | finality | default `getLogs` window |
|---|---|---|
| mainnet | `Depth(64)` — 64 blocks behind tip | 20 |
| arbitrum-one | `FinalizedTag` — the node's L1-aware `finalized` tag, falling back to a depth | 2000 |
| base | `FinalizedTag`, same fallback | 1000 |

An L2 is a data entry here, not a fork of the indexer.

Sealing is where the append-only guarantee is made: **a segment is written strictly past finality, so
the columnar layer never sees a reorg.** If a change ever requires mutating a sealed segment, the
design is wrong and we go back rather than add a mutation path.

All tables in a nest seal together per finalized range, so `sealed_through` stays a single global
watermark — which is what lets hot and cold be unioned without deduplication.

## Reorgs — `store.rs::rollback_to`

A reorg only ever touches the hot store. Detection asks whether the last block we committed against
is **still canonical** — the `blocks` table stores each block's hash, so `detect_reorg` re-checks that
hash against the chain and walks back to find the common ancestor. Recovery is `rollback_to(block)`,
a range delete above the fork point inside one write transaction, which is exactly the operation the
zero-padded key ordering makes cheap.

Because sealing is strictly past finality, there is no ordinary case where a reorg reaches a segment.
A reorg *below* `sealed_through` is a finality violation this model cannot repair — the doomed blocks
are already in immutable segments and pruned from hot, so a retraction would be silently incomplete
and the two layers would permanently disagree. So it **bails** rather than quietly rewriting history,
and that nest stays down until an operator looks at it rather than being backed off and re-admitted.

One detail worth having, because it was a real blind spot: if a boundary's hash could not be stored,
treating "no hash here" as "nothing to verify" would skip the check entirely. It walks to the nearest
stored checkpoint instead.

Random reorg depths are property-tested to converge on canonical chain state.

## Derived state — `views.rs`, `exposure.rs` (DBSP)

The differentiator, and it is real rather than aspirational: derived entities are **incremental views
maintained by DBSP circuits**, not hand-written update logic.

Nobody writes "on transfer, load balance, add, save". Balance is stated as `Σ(in) − Σ(out)` and the
circuit maintains it. The payoff is that **a reorg is a retraction** — the same circuit that consumes
a `+1` delta consumes a `−1`, so rollback correctness is a property of the engine rather than of
remembering to write the inverse of every handler.

Counterparty exposure (the compliance path) is a second circuit over the same facts.

## Query — `analytics.rs`, `serve.rs`

Two surfaces over the same data.

**Point-reads** come from redb directly — entity by id, balances, flags. Cheap, no SQL engine
involved.

**Analytical SQL** is an embedded DuckDB that **attaches the sealed segments read-only**. The
ingestion path never writes DuckDB. For `/sql`, hot rows are scanned into per-table temp tables and
`UNION ALL`'d into each table's view.

The union is exact **without deduplication**, and that is structural rather than careful: cold
includes only segments at or below `sealed_through`, hot only rows above it. The two sets cannot
overlap, even during the brief window between sealing and pruning.

Results carry **provenance** — the block range and the content-addressed segment hashes they were
computed from — so a number can be cited and re-derived.

`/sql` is a genuine analytical surface exposed to callers, so it is guarded: a 30-second timeout, a
50,000-row cap, a 64 MiB result ceiling, 2 concurrent analytical queries, a 16 KiB query-length limit,
and a refusal past 2,000,000 unsealed tip rows. That last one **refuses rather than truncating**,
because a partial tip silently changes the answer to an aggregate, and a wrong number is worse than an
error.

Two controls stop `/sql` touching the filesystem, deliberately with different failure modes — see
[security](/docs/operate/security/).

## Factories — `factory.rs`

Uniswap-class protocols are unindexable without dynamic data sources: the children do not exist when
you write the config. A *factory* watches an event (`PoolCreated`) and indexes the child it announces
under a *template* ABI, into shared `{template}__*` tables.

At the tip this is a topic0-only fetch, so N discovered children cost roughly one child's RPC budget
rather than N.

## Packaging — `blob.rs`, `distribution.rs`

A nest's *authored inputs* — config, ABIs, views, labels, skills — canonicalise into a **bundle**
pinned by a Merkle root. `nest load` verifies the manifest, every file's bytes, and that the decode
registry regenerated from those inputs matches the author's pinned hash. A nest that cannot reproduce
its own registry is refused.

That makes a bundle **tamper-evident**, which is not the same as safe — a valid bundle can still
declare outbound endpoints you would rather it did not, so `load` warns about every non-loopback URL
and ranks link-local/metadata addresses at `error`.

A registry (a directory, or any S3-compatible bucket) adds `publish`/`pull` by `name@version`.

## The roost — `roost.rs`

One runtime, many nests, **one isolated cursor per distinct chain**. Nests on the same chain share a
cursor and one `getLogs` per window — N nests for roughly one nest's RPC cost — with per-nest
namespaced stores.

The law: **a cursor is always single-chain, single-writer, one observable failure boundary.** Two
chains are never multiplexed behind one cursor. A second chain means a second cursor.

The RAM budget is **≤2 GB per active-chain cursor**, CI-enforced. A mount whose projected footprint
would exceed it is refused with a `507` rather than admitted with a warning — a budget that can be
quietly exceeded is not a budget.

A faulting nest is **quarantined**, not fatal: its healthy siblings keep indexing and serving, and it
is re-admitted on a backoff if the fault was retryable. Blast radius is bounded in both directions —
a nest's error no longer kills its cursor, a cursor's death no longer kills the roost.

## What changes in scaled mode — `pgstore.rs`, `worker.rs`, `scheduler.rs`, `controlplane.rs`

The same business logic, pointed at different substrates behind a `HotStore` trait. There are no
`#[cfg]` forks of the pipeline; it is a role flag, and it is opt-in at build time so the default
binary carries no database driver.

- **`pgstore.rs`** — the same `HotStore` contract over Postgres.
- **`controlplane.rs`** — *desired state*. What should run, not what does.
- **`scheduler.rs`** — placement, written as a **pure function** of `(workers, desired nests, current
  assignments)`. No database, no clock, no network, because placement is where the interesting
  mistakes live — double assignment, silent under-scheduling, churn — and none of them need
  distribution to reproduce.
- **`worker.rs`** — the reconcile loop: heartbeat, take a lease per assigned cursor, index what it
  holds, pull from the registry what it does not have.

**Ownership is enforced by the store, not by agreement.** Every write carries a fence; a stalled
worker that wakes to find its lease reassigned has its writes *refused* inside the same transaction as
the write. That is what makes `--scale writer=N` safe.

The control plane and the lease are **deliberately independent**: a control-plane outage stops
*rescheduling*, not *ingestion*. Measured — 377 blocks indexed through a 90-second outage.

Scaled mode is younger than embedded and has not carried a production workload for anyone. Until
v0.9.3 the writer pool took leases and ran no indexing at all; see
[verifying a deployment](/docs/operate/verifying/) for what that cost and how it is checked now.

## The transform escape hatch — `transform.rs`

For logic that declarative views cannot express, a `wasm32-wasip2` component exporting
`nuthatch:transform/stage`. The host grants it **zero capabilities** — base WASI only, stderr for
logging, no filesystem, no network, no key-value.

That is the point. **A component with no capabilities is deterministic by construction**, and only
zero-capability components may feed entity derivation. Effectful components produce *annotations*,
never canonical entities, and purity is checkable from the composition manifest rather than by reading
code.

Interfaces take **batches** — lists of events or Arrow IPC buffers — never one event per call, because
a per-event boundary cannot survive backfill throughput.

## Where to start reading

`indexer.rs` for the loop, `registry.rs` for what makes it deterministic, `store.rs` and `seal.rs` for
why a reorg cannot corrupt history. The design record is in the
[RFCs](/docs/contributing/rfcs/) — numbered, and honest about what was wrong.
